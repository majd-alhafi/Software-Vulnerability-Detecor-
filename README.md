# Software-Vulnerability-Detecor-
Application security is an essential part of developing modern software. As the internet increases in complexity, attackers are turning more and more to known security flaws and vulnerabilities in programs themselves. To avoid data breaches, companies need to build security into all the phases of building, testing and deploying their software. There are different techniques to detect vulnerability such as Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) but these solutions suffer from high false-positive and high false-negative rates. Researchers have been interested to develop an AI-based system to detect vulnerabilities using Deep Learning models such as Bert, BLSTM, etc. In this project, two deep learning models were developed for vulnerability detection in C/C++ source codes, one is to detect if source code contains any vulnerability (binary classification model) and the other (multiclass classification model) to classify this vulnerability. The binary classification model consists of CNN and the multiclass classification model consists of Convolutional+ LSTM. Results over the dataset, for the binary classification model, the accuracy is 96%. For the multiclass classification model, the accuracy is 98% to classify over 50 different types of vulnerabilities.
